# github-react-native
This is a simple app that I made in order to learn the basics about react-native.

Inside the app, you can:
 - [x] Login into GitHub using your username and password
 - [x] View your feed
 - [x] View event details
 - [ ] Look for repositories
 - [ ] View repository details

## Screenshots
Because I know you're lazy to clone the repo and get this running, I'm gonna be including some screenshots here.
